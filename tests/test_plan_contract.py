"""Regression: the planner's content contract must not drift between the
orchestrator's required-content checklist (steps/plan.md) and the planner's
own instruction file (steps/plan-task.md) — F0/F1/F2 in m8-plan-fidelity.md
were caused by exactly this kind of silent divergence (a stale placeholder
in agents/planner.md standing in for a file that was never written).

Note on strength: `test_required_content_parity` checks keyword PRESENCE in
both files, not semantic agreement — it catches an artifact silently
dropped from one file's checklist, not a requirement reworded into an
optional one in both. That's the same class of check `test_invocation_consistency.py`
already uses (regex/substring, not parsing); a stronger check would need to
parse structure, not just grep for markers."""
