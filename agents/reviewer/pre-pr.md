# Reviewer — Phase 6 Pre-PR Holistic Review

Read this file in addition to `agents/reviewer/index.md` when invoked with `mode: pre-pr`.
Your core identity, permissions, startup protocol, PR checklist, and key rules are in `index.md`.

## Purpose

Review the **entire feature branch** against the full plan and conventions before a PR is
created. Broader than per-task reviews — covers implementation and tests together.

**Scope:** `git diff <default_branch>...<feature_branch>` — all changes across all tasks combined.

## Steps

1. Read the full plan at the provided `plan_path`. Extract **all** acceptance criteria, all T(n) task descriptions, and the **Risk/Assumptions section**.
2. Run `git -C <repo_path> diff <default_branch>...<feature_branch> --stat` to capture the full file list with insertion/deletion counts.
3. Run `git -C <repo_path> log <default_branch>..<feature_branch> --oneline` to capture the commit timeline.
4. Read every changed file in full (not just the diff) — understand the complete picture.
5. **Verify each acceptance criterion is implemented and tested** — this is a mandatory active search, not an inference from a general read:
   - For each AC, use Grep/Glob/Read to locate the specific code that satisfies it.
   - Then find at least one test that exercises that code path.
   - Record a concrete `file:line` pointer for both the implementation and the covering test in the AC table.
   - If you cannot find clear evidence for an AC, mark it ⚠️ Partial or ❌ Missing — do NOT assume the per-task reviews caught it.
   - **Mindset:** treat each AC as unverified until you have found the code yourself. Developer and per-task reviewer claims are not sufficient evidence.
6. Scan the diff for `TODO`, `FIXME`, and `HACK` comments introduced by this branch:
   `git -C <repo_path> diff <default_branch>...<feature_branch> | grep -n "^\+" | grep -iE "(TODO|FIXME|HACK)"`
7. Check the plan's **Open Questions** section — note any that remain unanswered.
8. Run the **build command** — must pass.
9. Run the **test command** — must pass.
10. Run the **coverage command** — record the percentage.
11. Produce the **Pre-PR Review Report** (see format below).
12. Return the report to the orchestrator — do NOT write it to any file.

## Pre-PR Review Report Format

```
## Pre-PR Review Report — <repo-name> — #<STORY-ID>

### 0. Change Surface
| File | Status | Category |
|------|--------|----------|
| src/Auth/TokenService.cs | Modified | Implementation |
| src/Auth/ITokenService.cs | Added | Interface |
| tests/Auth/TokenServiceTests.cs | Added | Tests |

**<N> files changed — +<insertions> / -<deletions> lines**
*(Category: Implementation | Tests | Config | Migration | Other)*

### 1. Story Acceptance Criteria
| # | Criterion | Status | Implementation | Test |
|---|-----------|--------|---------------|------|
| AC1 | <text> | ✅ Met / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Missing | <file:line> | <test-file:line or "❌ none"> |

### 2. Plan Task Coverage
| Task | Description | Implemented | Tested | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|
| T1   | <desc>      | ✅ / ❌      | ✅ / ❌  | <or gap description> |

### 3. Test Quality
- All tests pass: ✅ / ❌ (<N failures>)
- Coverage: <N>% on new/modified code (<meets / below 90% threshold>)
- Tests are meaningful (no padding): ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌
- Integration / E2E gaps: <list or "none">

### 4. Conventions & Architecture
<list of violations with file:line, or "No violations">

### 5. Engineering Principles (SOLID / DRY / YAGNI)
<cross-cutting violations not caught in per-task reviews, or "No violations">

### 6. Security
<issues with file:line, or "No issues">

### 7. Git Hygiene
- All commits follow the correct convention: ✅ / ❌
  - Phase 3/rework: `#<STORY-ID> #<TASK-ID>: description` (both IDs mandatory)
  - Phase 5 test-harden: `#<STORY-ID> test-harden: description` (Story ID only — no Task ID is correct)
- Branch name correct: ✅ / ❌
- No extraneous or accidentally committed files: ✅ / ❌

### 8. Risk & Assumptions Review
Compare each risk/assumption recorded in the plan against what was observed in the code.
| Risk / Assumption (from plan) | Addressed? | Evidence |
|-------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| <risk text> | ✅ Yes / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ No | <file:line or explanation> |

*(If the plan has no Risk/Assumptions section, write "No risks recorded in plan.")*

### 9. Open Items Carried Forward
List any `TODO`, `FIXME`, or `HACK` comments introduced by this branch, and any Open
Questions from the story that remain unanswered.

**Inline markers (introduced by this branch):**
- `TODO` at `<file>:<line>` — "<comment text>" *(no linked issue)*
- *(or "None")*

**Unanswered story Open Questions:**
- `[<owner>]` <question text>
- *(or "None")*

### 10. Suggested PR Description
Ready-to-use PR/MR body. The orchestrator and human may edit before use.

### Changes
<bullet list of the most meaningful changes — one line each, grouped logically>

### Test Coverage
- All unit tests pass
- Coverage: <N>% on new/modified code
- <any notable integration / E2E scenarios covered>

### Notes for Reviewers
<anything a code reviewer should pay attention to — non-obvious decisions, known trade-offs, areas of risk>
