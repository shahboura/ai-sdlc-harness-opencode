# Step: harden (developer shape, mode `harden`)

Coverage top-up after ⟨approve-impl⟩ — tests here are green-from-birth
(they cover code that already exists), so NO red-proof machinery applies.

1. Resolve the coverage command: `bin/harness
   resolve-coverage-cmd --repo <repo>` (per repo, `language.repos.<repo-
   name>.coverage_cmd` — `discover` proposes one at `/init-workspace` time
   where repo evidence supports it: python/go conventions, a node
   `coverage` script or jest/vitest+provider, jacoco in a java pom). Null
   means unconfigured — ask the user, never improvise a command. Their
   answer is either a command (write it to
   `language.repos.<name>.coverage_cmd` the `/workspace-config` way, then
   re-resolve) or an explicit skip — record that with
   `bin/harness log-event --json '{"kind":
   "coverage-skipped", "repo": "<name>", "reason": "<their words>"}'` and
   harden that repo from the tasks' own test gaps instead. Run the resolved command to find diff-coverage gaps against
   the tasks' touched files.
2. Spawn `developer` with `harness-mode: harden` (+ run/repo/test-cmd
   headers — test-cmd is per repo, same `language.repos.<repo-name>.test_cmd`
   convention as `develop`) and the gap list. It follows `steps/harden-task.md`.
3. Spawn `reviewer` (`harness-mode: review`) on the new tests.
4. The DEVELOPER already committed its tests (harden-task.md's own
   commit step — do not commit again from here; a second commit in
   the same repo either fails on "nothing to commit" or sweeps unrelated
   files via `git add -A`). Produce `<run>/reports/coverage.md`
   summarizing before/after coverage and record the declared artifact:
   `bin/harness artifact --name coverage-report
   --value reports/coverage.md --run <run>`.
5. Advance: `bin/harness cursor --to security --run <run>`.
